High-RMSD analysis and fitting:
- No high-RMSD analysis or fitting
- No high-RMSD fitting, but show detected threshold for comparison
- No high-RMSD fitting, but show thresholded randombest for comparison
- Fit only on threshold
- Fit only on threshold, but also show thresholded randombest for comparison
- Fit on thresholded randombest

Threshold detection computation parameters:
- Best-of factor
- Redundancy
Best-of factor x redundancy trajectories, take trajectory[redundancy]

Thresholded randombest computation parameters:
- Number of structures to generate
(Number of structures to sample is Best-of factor x this)
Thresholded randombest fitting parameters:
- Number of highest-RMSD structures to discard
- Mode: 
    - binning
    - lowest RMSD point
    - middle RMSD point
    - highest RMSD point
- Number of bins

Low-RMSD analysis and fitting:
- No low-RMSD analysis or fitting
- No low-RMSD fitting, but show greedy intercept for comparison
- No low-RMSD fitting, but show near-native intercept for comparison
- Greedy intercept
- Fit on greedy intercept, but also show near-native intercept for comparison
- Fit on greedy intercept, but also show near-native ensemble for comparison
- Near-native intercept 
- Fit on near-native intercept, but also show greedy intercept for comparison
- Near-native ensemble
- Fit on near-native ensemble, but also show greedy intercept for comparison

Greedy intercept computation parameters
