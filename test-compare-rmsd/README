Comparing near-native ensembles computed towards structure A to their RMSDs towards structure B
(../test/compare-rmsd.py tool)
Structures are dodecapeptides or octapeptides.
Fragment library is PEP-FOLD.
Look for dodeca 66 vs 2 for a case where RMSD space looks flat
From dodeca 21 to 58 it is also flat, but definitely not from 58 to 21!
